# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Feature
Native Dynamic Spec-Driven Development (SDD) & Bidirectional Agent Workflow

## Summary
To ensure the codebase strictly adheres to a "documentation-first" paradigm without relying on external frameworks like Open-Spec or Spec-Kit, `aio-sdlc` requires a native, dynamic Spec-Driven Development (SDD) protocol. This protocol formalizes a tight, bidirectional feedback loop between the Architect, Implementer, and QA agents. It ensures that specs dictate code generation in a highly prescriptive, deterministic format, while simultaneously empowering implementers to challenge and push specs back to the Architect for revision when technical reality dictates it.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want the framework to rely entirely on native Markdown SDDs so that documentation and code evolve synchronously without third-party dependencies.
- As an Architect Agent, I need my technical specs in the `specs/` directory to natively bind to the Intention DAG, so that any update to a spec triggers the Diffing Engine to audit the code.
- As an Implementer Agent, when I discover a spec is technically unviable or conflicts with an existing system, I need a formal pathway to halt my task and return a "Variance Report" to the Architect for spec revision.

## Requirements
- **Deprecate External Integrations**: Remove all parsing logic and dependencies related to Open-Spec and Spec-Kit.
- **Deterministic Spec Templates**: The Architect Agent MUST NOT rely on LLM generation to format spec documents. The framework MUST provide programmatic scripts or CLI commands (e.g., `aio-sdlc generate-spec`) that scaffold strict, prescriptive Markdown templates. This ensures perfect repeatability, saves tokens, and forces the Architect to fill in required technical fields uniformly.
- **Native Spec Binding**: The `aio-sdlc` Diffing Engine MUST natively parse these standardized Markdown specs in the `specs/` directory. Each spec MUST map directly to a node in the IDAG. Modifying a spec file inherently creates a DAG diff.
- **Bidirectional Feedback Loop**:
  - **Top-Down**: PRD (`inbox/`) ➔ Architect updates IDAG & writes SDD (`specs/`) ➔ Implementer writes code.
  - **Bottom-Up (Pushback)**: If an Implementer hits a roadblock (e.g., library limitation, spec conflict), it MUST halt execution, throw an exception, and generate a structured "Spec Variance Report".
  - **Resolution**: The Orchestrator MUST route the Variance Report back to the Architect Agent. The Architect evaluates the feedback, rewrites the SDD, updates the IDAG, and re-issues the task.
- **Strict QA Enforcement**: The QA Swarm MUST act as the enforcer. Code cannot be merged unless the QA agents confirm the Reality Code is perfectly aligned with the newly dynamic SDDs.

## Out of Scope
- Integration with external wikis or documentation platforms (Confluence, Notion). SDDs MUST be standard Markdown files co-located with the codebase in Git.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The engine successfully parses `specs/*.md` natively, tying spec updates directly to DAG diffs without external libraries.
2. Implementer agents can successfully abort a task and trigger an Architect revision cycle when a spec is deemed unviable.
3. Every PRD processed from the inbox results in synchronized updates to both the IDAG and the local `specs/` folder before any implementation code is written.
