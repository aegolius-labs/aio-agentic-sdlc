description: Manage spec-driven software delivery with the AIO Agentic SDLC dual-DAG backlog and MCP tools. Use when Codex needs to interview for a PRD, detect duplicate requirements, plan or execute a feature through architect/implementer/QA roles, prioritize or update the agentic backlog, generate or reconcile intention and reality DAGs, validate GUID traceability, promote accepted specs, or prepare documentation and delivery.

# Manage AIO Agentic SDLC

Use deterministic MCP tools for state and artifacts. Use Codex reasoning for requirements,
architecture, implementation, review, and coordination.

## Select the workflow

- For feature ideation, discovery, or PRD work, read
  [references/roles/intake.md](references/roles/intake.md) and the researcher role it links to.
- For implementation, bug fixes, or end-to-end delivery, read
  [references/pipeline.md](references/pipeline.md) and
  [references/roles/orchestrator.md](references/roles/orchestrator.md).
- For a direct backlog, DAG, traceability, document-generation, or promotion request, read
  [references/tools.md](references/tools.md) and perform only that operation.
- For role-specific work delegated by an orchestrator, read only the matching file under
  `references/roles/` plus [references/safeguards.md](references/safeguards.md).

## Initialize context

1. Resolve the repository root to an absolute path.
2. Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` chain and the requested PRD or task artifact.
3. Inspect `intention-dag.yaml`, `reality-dag.yaml`, and runtime backlog state only as needed.
4. Pass the absolute repository root as `project_path` to every MCP tool that accepts it.
5. Prefer plugin MCP tools. If unavailable, use the local UV environment with `uv run`.
   Use the portable `uvx --from git+https://github.com/aegolius-labs/aio-agentic-sdlc`
   form only when the local checkout is not the intended implementation.

## Coordinate roles

- Keep one main agent responsible for state transitions and the final answer.
- Delegate only bounded, independent work when subagents are available and delegation is allowed.
  Prefer the matching project-scoped `sdlc_*` custom agent when it exists; otherwise give a
  generic subagent the matching role reference.
- Give each subagent the absolute repository path, exact artifact path, role reference,
  allowed files/actions, and expected return shape.
- Do not let multiple agents mutate the same files or DAG state concurrently.
- Run implementation and QA as a feedback loop until QA passes or a genuine blocker is recorded.
- Keep commits, pushes, pull requests, issue changes, and other external writes within the user's
  explicit authorization.

## Enforce invariants

- Never edit `intention-dag.yaml`, `reality-dag.yaml`, or backlog state by hand. Use MCP, CLI,
  or the Python API.
- Never manually alter generated document frontmatter or promote a spec with filesystem moves.
- Preserve canonical GUID traceability across DAG nodes, specifications, and source markers.
- Use UV for Python environment and command execution.
- Work test-first for implementation changes and run proportionate validation before completion.
- Follow [references/safeguards.md](references/safeguards.md) for blocking and delivery rules.

## Return results

State the outcome first. Include changed artifact paths, DAG/backlog transitions, validation
commands and results, and any unresolved blocker. Avoid dumping subagent transcripts.
