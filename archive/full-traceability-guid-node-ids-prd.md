# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Full Traceability via GUID Node IDs

## 1. Overview
Currently, mapping elements across the AIO-Agentic-SDLC framework—from intentions to reality, specifications, and code—can be susceptible to mismatches. To eliminate these mismatches and provide robust traceability, we require a standardized ecosystem-wide adoption of strict Node IDs (Integer or GUID).

## 2. Goals & Objectives
* **Eliminate Mismatches**: Prevent misalignments between intention nodes, reality nodes, specifications, and implemented code.
* **Full Traceability**: Ensure an uninterrupted, auditable trail across the board (Intention -> Reality -> Spec -> Code).
* **Ecosystem Standardization**: Make ID-based referencing a fundamental constraint in the framework's architecture.

## 3. Core Requirements
1. **Node ID Standardization**: Every node (Intention, Reality) must be uniquely identified by a strict Integer or GUID. String-based fuzzy matching or reliance on mutable node names is strictly prohibited.
2. **Specification Linkage**: When an architectural specification is generated for a specific node, it MUST explicitly reference the Node ID.
3. **Implementation Traceability**: The generated code and internal execution flows must carry or reference these Node IDs in metadata, comments, or data structures.
4. **Validation Mechanism**: The framework MUST automatically validate that IDs consistently align across `intention-dag.yaml`, `reality-dag.yaml`, `specs/`, and codebase reality.

## 4. Non-Goals
* Refactoring the entire execution logic—this requirement focuses exclusively on the traceability constraints across architectural state representations.

## 5. Next Steps
* The Orchestrator agent should parse this requirement and plan the migration of existing schema states (`intention-dag.yaml`, `reality-dag.yaml`) to enforce strict GUID/Int node IDs.
