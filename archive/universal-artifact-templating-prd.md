# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Universal Artifact Templating Engine

## 1. Introduction
The Universal Artifact Templating Engine aims to standardize and automate the generation of documentation artifacts (PRDs, SDDs/Specs, Research Spikes) across the AIO-Agentic-SDLC framework. By leveraging research-backed formats and programmatic generation, the engine ensures that all documents are structured optimally for Large Language Model (LLM) parsing and processing, eliminating the need for manual formatting by agents.

## 2. Objectives
*   **Standardize Document Structures**: Ensure all framework-generated documents adhere to a consistent, LLM-optimized structure.
*   **Automate Document Generation**: Provide agents with programmatic tools (CLI/MCP) to generate documents, removing the need for agents to manually write or format Markdown.
*   **Enhance LLM Parsing**: Utilize specific file structures, such as Markdown with YAML frontmatter, proven to be easily parsed and understood by LLMs.
*   **Centralize Template Management**: Store all document templates in a dedicated, static `templates/` directory.

## 3. Scope
This PRD covers the design, implementation, and integration of the Artifact Templating Engine within the AIO-Agentic-SDLC framework. It specifically targets the following document types:
*   Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) (e.g., in `inbox/`)
*   Software Design Documents (SDDs) / Technical Specifications (e.g., in `specs/`)
*   Research Spikes

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Research-Backed Formats
*   **Requirement**: The final document templates MUST be designed based on dedicated research into file structures optimally parsed by LLM agents.
*   **Details**:
    *   Templates should heavily utilize Markdown for structural clarity (headings, lists, code blocks).
    *   Templates MUST incorporate YAML frontmatter to store structured metadata (e.g., author, date, status, document type, related entities).
    *   The structure should facilitate easy extraction of specific sections (e.g., requirements, constraints) by downstream agents.

### 4.2. Static Template Storage
*   **Requirement**: All base templates MUST be physically persisted as static files within the codebase.
*   **Details**:
    *   A new dedicated directory named `templates/` MUST be created at the root of the project.
    *   Individual template files (e.g., `prd-template.md`, `sdd-template.md`, `research-spike-template.md`) will reside in this directory.
    *   These templates will serve as the source of truth for document structures.

### 4.3. Programmatic Generation (CLI/MCP)
*   **Requirement**: Agents (such as Intake or Architect) MUST NO LONGER manually construct or format these artifact files.
*   **Details**:
    *   The framework MUST expose dedicated CLI commands or MCP tools for document generation.
    *   **Input**: Agents will call these tools, providing raw data as structured arguments (e.g., via YAML or JSON).
    *   **Process**: The tool will automatically:
        1. Read the corresponding base template from the `templates/` directory.
        2. Inject the provided raw data into the template (e.g., using a templating engine like Jinja2 or a simple substitution mechanism).
        3. Write the fully populated document to the designated target directory (e.g., `inbox/` for PRDs, `specs/` for SDDs).
    *   **Error Handling**: The tools must validate the provided data against the required fields of the template and return clear errors if data is missing or malformed.

## 5. User Stories
*   **As the Intake Agent**, I want to call a tool with structured JSON containing user requirements, so that a perfectly formatted PRD is automatically generated in the `inbox/` without me worrying about Markdown syntax.
*   **As the Architect Agent**, I want to invoke an MCP tool with my design decisions, so that an SDD is generated in the `specs/` directory using the standard, LLM-optimized template.
*   **As a Developer/Maintainer**, I want to update the structure of all future PRDs by modifying a single file in the `templates/` directory, so that standardizing documentation is easy and central.

## 6. Success Metrics
*   **Agent Reliability**: 100% of newly generated PRDs, SDDs, and Research Spikes conform strictly to the defined templates.
*   **Agent Efficiency**: Reduction in the token usage and time taken by agents to generate documentation, as they only need to output structured data (JSON/YAML) rather than formatting entire Markdown files.
*   **Parseability**: Downstream agents exhibit a lower error rate when reading and extracting information from the newly templated documents compared to manually formatted ones.
