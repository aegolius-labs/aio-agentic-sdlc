# Technical Research Spike: Health Check Tool for MCP Server

## 1. Overview
This research spike addresses the implementation details for the `health_check` tool required by the `mcp_server.py`. External orchestrator agents, such as Antigravity, will use this tool to determine liveness with sub-50ms latency.

## 2. Technical Findings
- **Server Framework:** The project uses `FastMCP` from `mcp.server.fastmcp` to expose tools and resources. The server is instantiated as `mcp = FastMCP("Agentic Backlog")`.
- **Tool Registration:** New tools are registered using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator.
- **Latency Requirement:** The tool must respond in `<50ms`. By returning a static dictionary or JSON string, the operation is simply a memory allocation and return, easily fitting within a 1ms bounds, well below the 50ms requirement.
- **Dependencies:** `json` is already imported in `mcp_server.py` and can be used to dump the required JSON object: `{"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0"}`.
- **Authentication:** The `FastMCP` framework currently does not enforce authentication on tools unless specifically configured, which aligns with the requirement for the tool to be accessible without authentication.

## 3. Implementation Plan
### File to modify: `src/aio_agentic_sdlc/mcp_server.py`

**Code Addition:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def health_check() -> str:
    """Check the health and liveness of the MCP server."""
    return json.dumps({"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0"})
```

### File to modify: `tests/test_mcp_server.py` (if applicable)
Add a basic test to ensure `health_check()` returns the expected JSON response string.

## 4. Architectural Decisions
- The tool will be implemented as an `@mcp.tool()` rather than a resource (`@mcp.resource()`) as external orchestrators typically invoke it as an active ping (tool call) to verify execution pathways.
- The `version` is hardcoded as `"1.0.0"` in accordance with the PRD's acceptable static constraints (Out of Scope: Dynamic version fetching).
- No new libraries are required; the standard library's `json` module is sufficient.

## 5. Viability Status
**Viable.** The implementation is extremely straightforward, carrying minimal risk and meeting all PRD criteria.
